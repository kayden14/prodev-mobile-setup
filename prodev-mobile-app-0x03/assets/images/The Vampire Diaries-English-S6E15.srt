00:00:02,001 --> 00:00:03,544
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

2
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,046
Luke is gone. He merged with Kai.

3
00:00:05,254 --> 00:00:06,547
- Kai won. - I always win.

4
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:09,008
I would've done anything. You chose death over me.

5
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:10,468
I never wanna see you again.

6
00:00:10,676 --> 00:00:13,179
Bonnie needs magic to get out. We need to tell her where to find some.

7
00:00:13,387 --> 00:00:15,223
Damon, you're a genius.

8
00:00:15,431 --> 00:00:17,308
Caroline's mom isn't doing too hot.

9
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:19,894
Caroline was meant to be extraordinary.

10
00:00:20,102 --> 00:00:22,146
And she needs to know how proud I am of her.

11
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:25,399
- You tell her yourself. - When you told me you hated me...

12
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,985
I think we both know I never really hated you.

13
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,950
She's gone.

14
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:45,127
Okay, I've got Band-Aids, surgical gear, and a medevac en route for an airlift.

15
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:47,672
You're making fun of me.

16
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:50,758
No, sweetheart, I'm making fun of me.

17
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:56,889
There is no greater first than watching your kid ride without training wheels...

18
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:58,182
- Ow! - Oh, boy.

19
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,644
...And no worse first than seeing them bite the dust.

20
00:01:02,311 --> 00:01:04,272
All right. There.

21
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,690
- Mommy? - Yes?

22
00:01:05,898 --> 00:01:07,024
Am I gonna die?

23
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:10,444
I would say your chances of survival are 100 percent.

24
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,154
Are you gonna die?

25
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:21,122
Well, everyone dies eventually, sweetie, but not for a long, long time.

26
00:01:21,789 --> 00:01:24,584
But what if you die and I'm still here?

27
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:31,132
Well, then, you'll be all grown up and you won't need me.

28
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:34,844
I think I'll always need you.

29
00:02:21,932 --> 00:02:24,477
Sorry, just...

30
00:02:24,685 --> 00:02:27,229
- Water. - Help yourself.

31
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:32,026
So, what are you not writing?

32
00:02:32,943 --> 00:02:35,780
Would you believe your mother entrusted me to eulogize her?

33
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:39,075
That's nice, I guess.

34
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,538
I think she was trying to teach me a lesson about my own mom.

35
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,291
I was supposed to do the eulogy at her funeral, and I...

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,085
We don't have to share.

37
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,421
Right.

38
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:58,427
I just mean...

39
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:02,932
...today is pretty much gonna be the worst day of my life.

40
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:06,352
I'm not sure I need to start it off by bonding with you. No offense.

41
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,065
- None taken. - Great.

42
00:03:11,982 --> 00:03:13,067
Thanks for the water.

43
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:16,904
Hey, blondie.

44
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,575
Today isn't the worst day of your life.

45
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:24,120
Today and tomorrow, it's a cake walk.

46
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:30,042
There'll be people around you day in and day out, like they're afraid to leave you alone.

47
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,211
The worst day?

48
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:34,130
That's next week.

49
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,509
When there's nothing but quiet.

50
00:03:40,052 --> 00:03:41,762
Just a heads-up.

51
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,684
Appreciate the tip.

52
00:03:46,892 --> 00:03:48,728
Sure.

53
00:03:50,187 --> 00:03:52,314
Anytime.

54
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:16,255
You've all asked what you can do to help.

55
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,674
There are five days' worth of projects on here.

56
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,968
We are going to do them in one.

57
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,971
We can break the rules and cut through the red tape.

58
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:28,809
Yeah. I expect my mom to be properly celebrated and buried by the end of the day.

59
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,770
Sure, Care. Whatever you need.

60
00:04:30,978 --> 00:04:33,314
Elena. You're coming with me.

61
00:04:33,522 --> 00:04:35,983
- Where are we going? - Casket shopping.

62
00:04:38,277 --> 00:04:39,487
Let's move.

63
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,365
You drive.

64
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,992
I sent my car to Jeremy.

65
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:47,828
Jeremy. I forgot to put him on my list of people to call.

66
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,830
It's okay, I called him.

67
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:04,261
It's day 278 inside this stupid prison world.

68
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,017
I have two broken toes, nine blisters and an ear infection, but I don't care.

69
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:13,103
I have phesmatos'd the crap out of this magic Canadian rock...

70
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,940
...and I have my magic again.

71
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:19,693
And when that eclipse hits 12:28...

72
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,571
...I'm going home.

73
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,701
You hear that, me? Home.

74
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,543
You sure you don't want me to hold your hair back?

75
00:05:35,751 --> 00:05:37,378
Stay away from me.

76
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:39,088
This is gross.

77
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:41,882
We haven't been dating long enough for you to see gross.

78
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,803
I have guilt. The vegan dish I made fun of did you in.

79
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm dying.

80
00:05:47,888 --> 00:05:49,890
Stupid Thai food.

81
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,475
Never again. Unh!

82
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,229
You know, maybe we should just skip the funeral.

83
00:05:55,437 --> 00:05:56,814
We're going.

84
00:06:02,194 --> 00:06:04,738
Hey. Wait, wait, wait.

85
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:09,702
Look, I know you hate me, but I really, really need to see my sister.

86
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:12,788
- I think she'll pass. - What are you doing here?

87
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:18,836
I called to tell you I was sick and you hung up.

88
00:06:19,044 --> 00:06:21,130
Because I have food poisoning.

89
00:06:21,338 --> 00:06:24,300
Did the sound of me vomiting on the other end not clue you in?

90
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:28,762
There's an issue I've been worried about since the merge...

91
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:31,015
...because we didn't do it right. The whole:

92
00:06:31,223 --> 00:06:34,435
"You're not my twin. Hey, that's okay, close enough" plan.

93
00:06:34,643 --> 00:06:37,187
But it worked, which is, you know, cool.

94
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:40,232
Hey, I'm even a bit nice now, in case you were wondering.

95
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:45,237
But I've been waiting for the other shoe to drop. And, well, I think it's dropped.

96
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,488
Because I'm...

97
00:06:48,657 --> 00:06:50,159
Where's the bathroom?

98
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,078
- Oh, God. Ric. - Here.

99
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,502
I don't think you have food poisoning.

100
00:07:02,504 --> 00:07:07,509
I was supposed to merge my magic with you, but I got Luke's instead.

101
00:07:09,845 --> 00:07:13,849
Now I'm defective, and I think that's why you're sick.

102
00:07:15,809 --> 00:07:18,354
I kind of feel like I'm dying, actually.

103
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:23,359
And if I die, so do you, Dad, Liv and the rest of our dumb coven.

104
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:27,279
So could you please fix me?

105
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:30,199
Like, now?

106
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,840
What are you doing?

107
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,427
Borrowing one of father's ties for the funeral.

108
00:07:50,886 --> 00:07:54,348
He will skin you alive. Take mine.

109
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,394
Okay.

110
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:00,729
Did you finish the speech?

111
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:05,693
- Not quite. - It's an important speech.

112
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,820
I will finish it, Stefan.

113
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:10,197
Father said we're not to cry.

114
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,534
That is because Father is incapable of human emotion.

115
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:17,621
You are 10. You cry if you feel like it.

116
00:08:19,581 --> 00:08:21,709
- I don't think I will. - Why is that?

117
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:24,586
Mother's angel told me everything would be all right.

118
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,174
- When was this? - Last night.

119
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:32,261
In my sleep. She visited me.

120
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:33,512
Did she visit you?

121
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,765
I must have missed it.

122
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,894
There. Be on your way.

123
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:56,493
I see the eulogy is coming along swimmingly.

124
00:09:00,914 --> 00:09:01,957
It's percolating.

125
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,585
Listen, I need your advice.

126
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:08,005
And I need you to not be a dick about it. I have no one else to ask.

127
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:11,633
- This sounds promising. - What did I just say?

128
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,220
All right, look.

129
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,265
Something happened between Caroline and me.

130
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:20,601
Ooh. Finally.

131
00:09:20,809 --> 00:09:25,564
And then her mom died and I haven't had a chance to talk to her about it...

132
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,442
...and I don't know the best way to handle it.

133
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:31,904
Oh.

134
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:35,449
Pull the ripcord.

135
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,243
- What? - Well...

136
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:42,456
...she's not the one. If she was, you wouldn't have to ask.

137
00:09:42,664 --> 00:09:45,709
- Yeah, but I didn't even... - You've been in love twice in your life.

138
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,671
Setting aside that it was technically the same face...

139
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,507
...does this feel like that?

140
00:09:56,595 --> 00:09:59,598
Not all love is true love, brother.

141
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,100
Caroline wants the real deal.

142
00:10:01,308 --> 00:10:05,229
If you don't, then pull the ripcord before you make things worse.

143
00:10:05,979 --> 00:10:08,023
Just not today.

144
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,192
Let her have today.

145
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,783
Your mother was such a vibrant woman.

146
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:20,327
Even after your father ran off with that man.

147
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:22,162
Thank you, Mrs. McGruder.

148
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:25,040
I'm sure we'll see you at the funeral.

149
00:10:27,334 --> 00:10:31,004
Welcome to the world of awkward sympathies.

150
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,382
You have to be prepared with your responses.

151
00:10:33,590 --> 00:10:35,050
I recommend at least three.

152
00:10:36,009 --> 00:10:37,803
I don't know how you survived this.

153
00:10:38,011 --> 00:10:40,848
The responses will be different for each category of people.

154
00:10:41,056 --> 00:10:43,892
Friends of circumstance, casual acquaintances, loved ones.

155
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:45,811
I kissed Stefan.

156
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:51,817
I want to talk to him about it, but if it's bad, I feel like he won't be honest.

157
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,068
You know, not today.

158
00:10:53,777 --> 00:10:57,406
Then talk to him about it tomorrow. You already have a lot on your plate.

159
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:02,202
I think I need to know today.

160
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:05,873
We're behind schedule. Let's go.

161
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:15,007
- Any joint pain? - Mm-hm.

162
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:16,383
- Headaches? - Yep.

163
00:11:17,217 --> 00:11:18,260
Are you pregnant?

164
00:11:19,219 --> 00:11:20,554
Stop making jokes.

165
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:23,390
I feel like I'm being scrunched from inside out.

166
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:26,727
This is private. Does your baby-boo need to be here?

167
00:11:26,935 --> 00:11:30,355
I'm not leaving her alone with you, so deal with it.

168
00:11:31,064 --> 00:11:34,318
Okay, your vitals are fine. Your temperature is normal.

169
00:11:34,526 --> 00:11:37,321
I'll wait on pathology, but there's nothing medically wrong.

170
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,782
Yeah, duh, because I'm magically diseased.

171
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:44,870
- And you haven't puked in at least... - Oh.

172
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,129
Hey. Hey!

173
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:00,636
I feel better.

174
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:03,889
- Because you juice-boxed my magic. - Sorry, that was an accident.

175
00:12:04,097 --> 00:12:06,934
But I... Wow, I legitimately feel better.

176
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,231
- You need to give me your magic. - What?

177
00:12:12,439 --> 00:12:15,609
This faux merge is clearly failing.

178
00:12:15,817 --> 00:12:17,861
I was supposed to get your magic, right?

179
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:21,740
I don't know, put it in a teddy bear or a bedpan or whatever and give me.

180
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:27,079
Listen. I can just as easily break seven little bones in your hand with one squeeze, okay?

181
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:31,458
I can see you're skeptical, Ric. Can I call you Ric?

182
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,919
Hey, buddy, but here's the thing you need to know:

183
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:37,965
Is that Jo only survives if I do, okay?

184
00:12:38,173 --> 00:12:42,511
If that's not enough, the power that binds the prison worlds comes from the Gemini Coven.

185
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:46,848
If I die, the worlds collapse, all right?

186
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,518
I see vacancy.

187
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:52,646
Would you like me to start over with single syllables?

188
00:12:52,854 --> 00:12:55,148
Did you say "prison worlds"?

189
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,692
As in more than one?

190
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,028
Has no one ever mentioned that?

191
00:13:01,196 --> 00:13:02,948
This is it.

192
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,950
I'm ready.

193
00:13:05,158 --> 00:13:06,827
There's no one to stop me.

194
00:13:07,035 --> 00:13:08,537
I have magic.

195
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,122
The ascendant.

196
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,832
And the eclipse.

197
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:28,682
No.

198
00:13:30,183 --> 00:13:31,226
No.

199
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,040
I'm worried about Caroline.

200
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:56,710
I don't think she's handling this as well as she thinks she is.

201
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:59,629
- You're not done yet? - No, I'm not done.

202
00:13:59,838 --> 00:14:02,341
And I will never be done. I am not a nice person.

203
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:06,011
I shouldn't have to stand in front of the whole town and pretend to be nice.

204
00:14:06,219 --> 00:14:10,807
This is Liz having the last laugh from the great beyond.

205
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,185
Hey, easy.

206
00:14:13,393 --> 00:14:14,978
You are nice...

207
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,355
...ish.

208
00:14:17,105 --> 00:14:18,357
Not helping.

209
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,526
This isn't about you, Damon.

210
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:25,280
This isn't even about Liz. It's about Caroline and what she needs to hear.

211
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,118
Okay?

212
00:14:59,856 --> 00:15:01,650
You missed your speech.

213
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,653
I know.

214
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,738
Why?

215
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,826
I could not decide what to say.

216
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:16,039
You could have just said goodbye.

217
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,225
- I don't really have a choice. - Of course you have a choice.

218
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:40,021
It's your magic to give or not give.

219
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,524
What do you think I should do?

220
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:47,988
Look, my life is full of martyrs who cave to the bad guy...

221
00:15:48,196 --> 00:15:52,367
...trying to be heroes, and it never ends well.

222
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:56,872
Somebody inevitably gets hurt, or dead...

223
00:15:57,080 --> 00:16:01,126
...and that somebody could just as easily be you, or Bonnie...

224
00:16:01,334 --> 00:16:04,171
...regardless, no matter what you do.

225
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:10,385
So if you want to fight, and keep your magic, I will fight with you.

226
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:18,518
And if not, well, I loved you when you weren't a witch...

227
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:24,399
...and I'm pretty sure I will still love you regardless.

228
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,698
- Pretty sure? - At least 92 percent.

229
00:16:57,974 --> 00:16:59,017
Caroline?

230
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:03,897
Doing all right?

231
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:07,275
Yeah. Fine.

232
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:11,238
You know, all things considered.

233
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,121
Sure you're doing okay?

234
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,958
Mm-hm.

235
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,751
Yeah.

236
00:17:27,587 --> 00:17:29,381
No.

237
00:17:31,591 --> 00:17:33,343
I don't know.

238
00:17:34,469 --> 00:17:40,809
Just now I was supposed to put you into a category so I would know what to say...

239
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:46,856
...but then I realized I didn't know what category you would want to be put in...

240
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:53,488
...so I was thinking I guess there's no time like the horribly inappropriate present...

241
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,491
...to get to the bottom of that.

242
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,003
I could list the categories if you'd like.

243
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,672
Caroline, I...

244
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:18,263
I want to talk to you about all this, I do...

245
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:25,186
...but maybe when we're alone after you've had a chance to get through the day.

246
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,106
Yeah, God, of course.

247
00:18:29,357 --> 00:18:31,943
This is not the time. I'm so sorry.

248
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,445
Hey, hey.

249
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,532
Don't be sorry.

250
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,545
We'll talk when all of this is over.

251
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,910
Care?

252
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,374
They're ready.

253
00:19:27,582 --> 00:19:28,667
Do you need a minute?

254
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,337
No, I'm okay.

255
00:19:38,176 --> 00:19:41,805
I'm gonna be all right, Mom. I promise.

256
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,058
Everything will be fine after today.

257
00:19:52,273 --> 00:19:54,025
I'm ready.

258
00:19:55,652 --> 00:20:01,449
Okay. Clearly I've been dropped into a snowy-tundra hell dimension.

259
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,578
Either that, or I've finally had a psychotic break.

260
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,322
- There you are. You're late. - Yeah.

261
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:26,326
Liv used to say she hated all my ties, so I had to find a new one.

262
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:31,581
- Are you drunk? - That depends.

263
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:35,043
How many days in a row can someone drink before they're just normal?

264
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:38,421
- You're not going in there. - Back off, man.

265
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:41,925
It's Caroline's mom. I'm not missing her funeral.

266
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:49,724
I'm sorry about you and Liv. I know you've been going through a lot of crap.

267
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,186
But Caroline does not deserve you bringing it here.

268
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:06,407
We're here today to pay our tribute and our respect...

269
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,119
...to a pillar of our community.

270
00:22:10,328 --> 00:22:14,541
Our sister, our protector...

271
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:18,127
...Sheriff Elizabeth Forbes.

272
00:22:18,878 --> 00:22:22,590
We are also here today to show our love and support...

273
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,885
...for Liz's family and friends.

274
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,514
Not only have we sensed our own personal feelings of loss...

275
00:22:29,722 --> 00:22:31,724
...over her passing...

276
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,792
Calling Sheriff Forbes.

277
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,297
This is the last call for Sheriff Forbes.

278
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:04,924
No response.

279
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,345
Radio Number 2-6 is out of service...

280
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:13,683
...after 12 years and four months of police service.

281
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,477
Gone but never forgotten.

282
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,938
Center.

283
00:23:43,254 --> 00:23:46,382
Liz Forbes was my friend.

284
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:52,764
In her last moments, she asked me to pass along a message to her daughter.

285
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,601
But I cut her off before she could say too much.

286
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:59,354
Told her she could tell Caroline herself.

287
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,357
But she didn't get that chance.

288
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:10,406
Your mom wanted you to know how proud of you she was.

289
00:24:10,615 --> 00:24:12,784
And she should be.

290
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,329
You're a beautiful, strong woman...

291
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:20,708
...a generous friend...

292
00:24:21,709 --> 00:24:24,837
...and a bright light in a sea of dark.

293
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,008
She said you were extraordinary.

294
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:30,718
And you are.

295
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,681
And so was she.

296
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,518
Liz was a hero to this town.

297
00:24:38,726 --> 00:24:41,020
She was a hero to all of you.

298
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,231
And she was a hero to me.

299
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:50,655
Goodbye, sheriff.

300
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:53,324
You will be missed.

301
00:25:11,634 --> 00:25:14,387
Thank you all for coming.

302
00:25:14,595 --> 00:25:16,597
This is for my mom.

303
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,911
Good night. Thank you.

304
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:24,791
Thank you so much.

305
00:26:33,132 --> 00:26:35,802
I'm sober. Don't ask me to leave.

306
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:38,971
I'm not. I'm glad you pulled it together.

307
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,476
The thing is, Ty, I get it, all right?

308
00:26:43,684 --> 00:26:47,980
We've all been through so much that it's bound to make us a little crazy.

309
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:50,942
But I was thinking...

310
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,445
...you know, watching the way all those cops honored her today...

311
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:58,032
...I wanna be a part of something like that.

312
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:02,537
So I talked to one of the deputies, and he gave me an application.

313
00:27:03,412 --> 00:27:06,249
There's this officer training program.

314
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:10,128
It seems pretty cool, you know, like something I'm supposed to be a part of.

315
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:14,549
I got one for you too.

316
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,313
- Hey. Are you leaving? - Yeah.

317
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:32,817
I think I've done the whole funeral thing enough for one day.

318
00:27:33,025 --> 00:27:34,068
I'll walk you home.

319
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,238
No. It's two blocks. I'll be fine, Elena.

320
00:27:37,446 --> 00:27:40,366
I just don't think it's a good idea for you to be alone tonight.

321
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,411
I think that's exactly what I need, actually.

322
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,001
Thank you for everything you did today, Elena.

323
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:53,838
I'll never forget it.

324
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:56,090
You're welcome.

325
00:27:56,632 --> 00:28:01,179
- But... - I'll be fine, Elena. Okay?

326
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:04,849
I just had to get through today.

327
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:55,441
Oh, my God.

328
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:58,486
Let's do this.

329
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,740
Me, our coven and the prison worlds thank you.

330
00:29:03,991 --> 00:29:06,452
What exactly is this other prison world?

331
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,830
A place filled with crappy people like me, I'm sure.

332
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,001
Congrats. You're saving their miserable lives from oblivion.

333
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:20,633
Oh. Don't look so stressed. You never liked being a witch anyway.

334
00:29:20,841 --> 00:29:22,760
Shut up.

335
00:29:52,206 --> 00:29:54,125
Oh, God.

336
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,146
I can do this.

337
00:30:15,354 --> 00:30:19,525
The northern lights, the eclipse, they're both recurring events.

338
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,402
I can get out of here.

339
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:26,907
Come on.

340
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,784
Come on.

341
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,590
Who are you?

342
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,551
Who are you?

343
00:30:57,938 --> 00:30:59,940
It's done.

344
00:31:00,816 --> 00:31:02,651
Thank you.

345
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,779
And congratulations.

346
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,543
Have a good life, sissy.

347
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,807
What did he say?

348
00:31:35,893 --> 00:31:38,020
The reason I was sick.

349
00:31:38,979 --> 00:31:41,232
It wasn't food poisoning.

350
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,150
What was it?

351
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,654
He said I'm pregnant.

352
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:51,492
I don't know what to say. I... Hm.

353
00:31:51,992 --> 00:31:53,744
I don't know what to do with that.

354
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,416
Marry me.

355
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:04,213
What? No. No. That's a pity proposal.

356
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:08,134
You can't throw a pity proposal at a pregnant ex-witch.

357
00:32:08,342 --> 00:32:11,637
I don't even know if I want kids, let alone get married...

358
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:15,766
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

359
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:20,104
I bought this the day after your brother died.

360
00:32:20,312 --> 00:32:22,565
Caroline's mom was sick, and you were in danger...

361
00:32:22,773 --> 00:32:25,860
...and I just thought life's too short.

362
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:29,947
And I've been trying to plan for the right moment...

363
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:33,451
...which was supposed to be this morning with breakfast in bed...

364
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:37,830
...you know, until you started puking up last night's dinner. Heh, heh.

365
00:32:39,331 --> 00:32:41,167
Ric.

366
00:32:41,375 --> 00:32:45,713
Look, we can talk about choices and all that. We can.

367
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,636
But I would really love to have this baby with you.

368
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:58,893
It's, uh... It's something I never thought I'd have.

369
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:05,441
So this isn't a pity proposal, Jo.

370
00:33:07,067 --> 00:33:08,486
I love you.

371
00:33:20,414 --> 00:33:21,916
Marry me.

372
00:33:30,257 --> 00:33:31,884
I can't believe this.

373
00:33:33,093 --> 00:33:34,428
Are you sure?

374
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:37,097
At least 92 percent.

375
00:33:39,975 --> 00:33:44,104
Yes. Yes. Yes.

376
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,154
Nice speech.

377
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,156
Thanks.

378
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:56,784
What broke through the writer's block?

379
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,121
I just needed to be reminded that the goodbye wasn't about me.

380
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:07,461
I failed you by not doing the eulogy at our mother's funeral.

381
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:11,799
I didn't wanna fail anyone today.

382
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,392
I think you were wrong.

383
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,852
About Caroline.

384
00:34:24,061 --> 00:34:29,650
I realize that I may not be able to explain what I feel for her...

385
00:34:30,734 --> 00:34:32,069
...but it is something.

386
00:34:34,071 --> 00:34:37,366
And yeah, maybe all love isn't true love...

387
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:41,245
...in the messed-up way that you and I have experienced it...

388
00:34:43,622 --> 00:34:48,502
...but I think this could turn into something even better.

389
00:34:53,465 --> 00:34:57,177
Well, then, brother, stop wasting your time sitting here with me.

390
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:01,432
I think she could use a piece of news like that today.

391
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,234
I said I was fine, Elena.

392
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,945
I don't believe you.

393
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,287
All day, something has been bugging me.

394
00:36:48,997 --> 00:36:55,087
You wanted to pack this all in so quickly, like you had somewhere you needed to be.

395
00:36:55,295 --> 00:36:57,589
You were so concerned with getting through today...

396
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,300
...without a hint of how you'd feel tomorrow.

397
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:04,638
And then I realized.

398
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,099
You don't wanna feel tomorrow.

399
00:37:08,642 --> 00:37:12,229
That's the plan, right? You're not going to feel tomorrow.

400
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,149
Because you're gonna turn it all off.

401
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,028
I thought I could get through the rough patch...

402
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:25,409
...and then just pick myself up after like I usually do.

403
00:37:26,034 --> 00:37:30,497
But then Damon made me realize it's just going to get worse.

404
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:36,003
- You're listening to Damon? - I can't do worse, Elena.

405
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:39,256
Okay? I didn't even think there was a worse.

406
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,800
- It's better this way. - Better?

407
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:46,305
Caro... You're talking about flipping the humanity switch.

408
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:50,768
- There's nothing better about that. - That is your experience.

409
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:55,814
Okay? I have more control over my vampire self than you ever did.

410
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,108
My experience will be different.

411
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:02,404
It's not gonna be different, Care. It's gonna be deadly.

412
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:07,117
- You saw what happened to me when I did it. - Yeah, that's my point, Elena.

413
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,453
You did it.

414
00:38:09,661 --> 00:38:15,334
You couldn't handle the pain when your brother died, so you turned it off.

415
00:38:15,542 --> 00:38:18,003
Damon died, and you erased all your memories.

416
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:22,466
Stefan moved to Savannah and became an auto mechanic.

417
00:38:22,674 --> 00:38:26,345
Do you think that you guys are the only ones who get to escape grief?

418
00:38:26,553 --> 00:38:30,808
You just mentioned two of the biggest mistakes that I ever made.

419
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,936
Were they mistakes?

420
00:38:34,686 --> 00:38:38,524
Because when you came out the other end...

421
00:38:38,732 --> 00:38:41,401
...the worst part of the pain was gone.

422
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:45,197
And that's what I need.

423
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:48,200
I just need the pain to be gone.

424
00:38:48,408 --> 00:38:52,246
And if Stefan had said the right thing earlier, would that have changed your mind?

425
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,752
Yeah, I heard.

426
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,761
Well, he didn't, so it doesn't really matter.

427
00:39:13,475 --> 00:39:16,436
My mom is dead, Elena.

428
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,441
It hurts so bad I can't breathe.

429
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:25,821
I can't... I can't do worse. I can't, okay?

430
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:29,783
- I shouldn't have to. - No one should have to.

431
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,034
It's not fair.

432
00:39:32,786 --> 00:39:35,914
It's not. I get it, I do.

433
00:39:38,792 --> 00:39:41,795
I know that you think you have it all figured out...

434
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:46,466
...but please, listen to me.

435
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,219
I'm not gonna let you do this.

436
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:07,321
That's not your choice to make.

437
00:40:09,823 --> 00:40:13,035
Where'd you go, Elena? Call me back.

438
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,003
Bonnie?

439
00:40:23,962 --> 00:40:26,006
The one and only.

440
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:45,359
Oh, you made it.

441
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,613
Caroline?

442
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:53,784
Sorry to barge in, door was unlocked.

443
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,879
Caroline!

444
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,508
Caroline!

445
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:12,886
I don't get it.

446
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,806
So you were in my house in a 1903 prison world?

447
00:41:16,014 --> 00:41:17,599
Watch this.

448
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,769
I didn't know it was still on when I got pulled out.

449
00:41:21,895 --> 00:41:24,523
Congratulations. You shot some walls.

450
00:41:24,731 --> 00:41:26,858
- Just wait. - Who are you?

451
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,363
- Who are you? - What is this?

452
00:41:31,571 --> 00:41:32,864
There. Stop.

453
00:41:36,159 --> 00:41:38,161
Oh, my God.

454
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,913
What?

455
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,334
That's my mother.
